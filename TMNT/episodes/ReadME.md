# 🎬 Ninja Turtles Pizza Episodes 🐢

Welcome to the Ninja Turtles Pizza Episodes collection, where the turtle action is as hot as our freshly baked pizza! 🍕🐢

## About

This is the place where you'll find all the classic Ninja Turtles episodes. We've cooked up a slice of nostalgia for you, and we can't wait for you to dive into these legendary adventures. However, there's a tiny technical hiccup you should know about.

## The Radical Episode Dilemma 📼

Our beloved Ninja Turtles adventures are legendary and filled with epic battles against Shredder, mouthwatering pizza, and the spirit of camaraderie. These episodes are nothing short of iconic. 📺

But here's the thing: these episodes are bigger than allowed ... massive (not really)! 📽️

GitHub has a file size limit of 25MB, and some of these episodes, well, they're larger than life. They're so massive that even the turtles would have a hard time carrying them.

## The Solution: Hosting Like a Pro 🌐

But hey, don't worry! We love problem-solving as much as we love pizza. 🍕 So, here's what we did:

We've hosted the referenced episodes on our [official Ninja Turtles Pizza website](https://tmntpizzaco.com/episodes/TMNT.mp4). Now, you can link them, reminisce, and have a blast right from there. This episode is waiting for you to relive the turtle power in all its glory.
